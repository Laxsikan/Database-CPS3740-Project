Website 04/29/2023

In my coding project, I developed a dynamic banking website utilizing a robust 3-tier architecture to provide users with the ability to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on a secure database. This project was built on a stack of technologies that included MariaDB, Apache, PHP, MySQL, MySQL Workbench, FileZilla, and a Linux-based server environment.
